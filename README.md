# STAT318_regression_analysis_project
Independent project for STAT 318 (Regression Analysis and Statistical Models) 

I built a multiple linear regression model to investigate the most influential factors 
associated with the percentage of Massachusetts public high school graduates attending
institutions of higher education.

Skills applied: 
(1) data cleaning and manipulation with tidyverse
(2) multiple linear regression
(3) model evaluation (adjusted R-squared, AIC, BIC, and cross-validated average prediction error)
(4) model diagnostics (studentized deleted residual plot and normal probability plot)

Details about the project and data can be found in the final paper.
